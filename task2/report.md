# **Mini Project Task 2** #
This task handles most implementations as the one defined previously but with some key changes.

- Our package tuple now contains the package size which is a random number based on a maximum value that we define and truck capacity will decrease based on this number.

- Now the truck checks if the package fits within the remaining capacity and in case it doesn't the truck dispatches and leaves the package for the next truck.
