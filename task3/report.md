# **Mini Project Task 3** #
This task uses the task 2 as basis, which means most of the code is the same but with some key features.

- Now when the truck is full or can't fit the package because it's too big instead of instantly getting a new truck it waits a random time between two constants defined to simulate a more realistic approach.

- By doing this the conveyor belt will wait a random time to also make this approach more real.

- New logs were added in order to improve the system details.
